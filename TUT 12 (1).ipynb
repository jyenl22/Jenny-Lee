    "\n",
    "### Question 1: Patient Perspective\n",
    "How should the patient approach medical advice based on the outcome of the test?\n",
    "- Patients should not solely rely on the test results. If the result is positive, they should request follow-up testing to confirm the diagnosis.\n",
    "- If the result is negative, patients should still consider follow-up tests because the sensitivity is only 0.767, meaning false negatives are possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2: Healthcare Provider Perspective\n",
    "How should the risks of possible treatment side-effects be balanced against the potential untreated progression of Lyme disease?\n",
    "- Since the precision is only 0.204, healthcare providers should combine test results with other clinical evidence to avoid unnecessary treatments.\n",
    "- Providers should clearly communicate the limitations of the test to patients to build trust and reduce anxiety.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: System Perspective\n",
    "How should the relatively high rates of false positives and false negatives be handled?\n",
    "- To address high false positives and false negatives, the model may need recalibration.\n",
    "- Adjusting the model to predict more positives could improve sensitivity but may lead to increased unnecessary treatments, which needs to be balanced against ethical and practical concerns.\n"
